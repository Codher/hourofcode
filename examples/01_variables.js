// Welcome to Codher and Accenture's Hour of Code!
// Today we'll learn the basics of web development
// with JavaScript, CSS and HTML through some practical
// examples and we'll build a tiny application.
//
// This is a JavaScript file, you've probably noticed because
// it has a .js extension
// You've probably noticed that this doesn't really look
// like code too.
//
// These lines are called "inline comments", they are used
// for telling the computer that they are intended for humans
// and not for machines, they normally explain what code does.
//
// Ok, let's start building something. Are you ready?
//
// Great! Today we'll make a startup idea generator.
// We'll have to learn the basics of programming and three
// of the standard web technologies to make it happen.
// We only have an hour, so let's get started.

// This is a variable, it has three parts:
// The keyword var
// The variable name, in this case myStartup
// Its value, in this case "Facebook for cats".
//
// You can think of a variable as a box with a name
// You can put many different things (values) in these boxes,
// the ones we'll use today are called Strings, Numbers
// and Arrays.
// "Facebook for cats" is a string, that means it is a
// bit of text, you can tell because it is surrounded by
// double quotes.
var myStartup = "Facebook for cats";

// That's it! now everytime we write myStartup we will
// refer to its value.
// For example, we can show a popup with its value
alert(myStartup);

// There, did you see it?
// Popups are annoying, so we'll use console.log()
// instead when we carry on.

console.log(myStartup);
// console.log() is a function (we'll learn more about
// those later) that let's you see values

// The cool thing about variables is that we can change
// their contents. Let's improve myStartup now.
myStartup = "Twitter for cats";

// let's see what's in there
console.log(myStartup);
// Did you see? Now we wrote the improved version of
// myStartup to the JavaScript console.

// Variables are a very simple concept, but they are
// incredibly important to programming.
