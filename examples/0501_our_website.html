<!-- HTML is the language that tells the web browser what to display -->
<!-- Since it doesn't tell it what things do, we call it a markup language -->
<!-- Comments in HTML are set by these arrow looking things -->

<!-- HTML elements are declared by writing an opening and a closing tag -->
<!-- <element-name></element-name> -->
<!-- tags can contain other tags, making html very easy to read -->
<!DOCTYPE html>

  <!-- but is considered useful information for the browser -->
